# AI-Powered Chatbot for Supplier and Product Information
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to query a product and supplier database using NLP. The chatbot fetches relevant data from a PostgreSQL database and summarizes it using an open-source LLM (Large Language Model), providing a conversational experience. The frontend uses simple HTML and Bootstrap, while the backend is built using Python.

## Features
- Natural language querying of products and suppliers.
- Retrieves data from a MySQL/PostgreSQL database and provides summarized responses using an open-source LLM (e.g., Hugging Face's GPT-2, GPT-3, or LLaMA 2).
- Responsive web interface built with HTML and Bootstrap.
- Provides structured responses to user queries.
- Handles missing or incorrect queries gracefully.

## Usage
### All required libraries can be installed using a single-line command:
<!-- ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` -->
<!-- 
### To run the code:

#### Console-based version:
```bash
python app.py
```

#### Streamlit-based version:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
``` -->
